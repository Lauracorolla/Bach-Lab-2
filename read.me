Here my selection of some beautiful pieces that reveal the rich musical landscape from which Bach's Chaconne emerged
From Fast Dance to Bach: The Evolution of the Chaconne

Chaconne and Passacaglia: A Gradual Fusion While originating from different sources (chaconne as a dance from the New World via Spain, passacaglia likely from early Spanish street music), these forms gradually merged in the early Baroque. By 1600s in Italy, composers began treating them similarly, both using variations over a ground bass, particularly the descending tetrachord. The terms became nearly interchangeable, as seen in works like Biber's Passacaglia (1676), which uses the typical chaconne descending minor tetrachord. However, this similarity wasn't present from the start but was the result of a gradual fusion of the forms in art music. 

The Sarabande Connection: A Third Element The sarabande followed a different path: originally a fast and scandalous Spanish dance (zarabanda), it was banned in Spain in 1583 for its obscenity. Moving to Italy and France in the early 17th century, it underwent a dramatic transformation, becoming a slow, stately court dance in France.
Around 1650-1680, the three forms began to influence each other:
Sarabande contributed its:
Emphasis on second beat
Noble character
Slower tempo
While keeping distinct features:
Sarabande: binary form, melodic focus
Chaconne/Passacaglia: variation form, ground bass focus

COMMON ELEMENTS 
Harmonic patterns:
Descending tetrachord
Folia progression
Chromatic variants
Structural features:
Ground bass
Variation form
Strophic organization
Rhythmic elements:
Triple meter
Emphasis on second beat (from sarabande)
Walking bass (from passacaglia)




"¡Vida, vida, vidita bona!" - Juan Arañés (1624)
   - One of the earliest published chaconas
   - Fast, festive character
   - Simple, repetitive harmonic structure
   - Popular, dance-like text
   - Perfect example of original chaconne style



ITALIAN TRANSFORMATION  (early 1600s)
First major transformation:

1. Monteverdi - "Zefiro torna" (1632)
   - Perfect example of early Italian ciaccona
   - Lively, major 

2. Landi - "Passacaglia della Vita" (1619)
   - Combines popular elements (text about death, typical of early chaconnes) with "art music" treatment
   - Walking tempo - slower than Spanish chaconas but not yet as slow as later examples
   - Shows how these forms were becoming more refined while maintaining popular roots
   - Perfect example of transition from dance to art music

Further instrumental passages:
Corelli Chaccona Triosonate 1681


FRENCH DEVELOPMENT - The "Nobilization" Process

Happened gradually through these elements: :
1. The aristocratization of the dance in France
2. Development as autonomous instrumental form in Italy
3. Sarabande influence bringing:
   - Emphasis on second beat
   - Noble character
   - Slower tempo



 Lully - Chaconne from "Phaëton" (1683)
Uses descending chords in major mode
Shows noble character while maintaining some liveliness
Perfect example of French courtly style



Marais - "Chaconne en Rondeau" for viola da gamba
 Uses minor tetrachord
Maintains faster tempo



ENGLISH DEVELOPMENT
 Purcell Upon a groud 1690
Purcell when I 'm laid (discendent minor tretrachor)
Handel : ciacona (1705, for harpsichord)


 


GERMANY
German contrapuntal elaboration requiring a more settled tempo


Buxtehude - Chaconna in E minor c. 1670 
   - Shows transition to German style
   - More harmonically elaborate


This cross-pollination of forms created a rich environment that eventually led to the complex treatment we find in late Baroque works like Bach's Chaconne, where elements from all three forms are masterfully combined into a new, transcendent form.
The evolution shows how these dances, originally distinct, gradually merged their characteristics while maintaining some identifying features, contributing to the development of the "serious" instrumental music of the late Baroque.
Focused practise
Break down the crucial elements of the first measure and work on them separately, since managing all aspects simultaneously can be overwhelming 
First things first: perfect intonation (foundations!)
Arm levels 
Bow pressure - finding that sweet spot between too much and too little
The speed of the chord rolls - how fast should we break those chords?
Decisions about the chords:
How many notes do we play together?
Do we keep that top note singing alone or with another voice?
Voice leading - making those lines sing
Overall direction - where are we going with this?
About tempo,I believe it shouldn't stray too far from what I call the "natural tempo," around 60 beats per minute, like a calm heartbeat.

Pitch in Bach's Time: A Complex Historical Matter
In Bach's time, musical pitch was far from standardized. The tuning fork we use today as a reference tool didn't even exist until 1711, when English trumpeter John Shore invented it, and it wouldn't become common until much later. Without such precise measuring tools, musicians relied on different methods for tuning, primarily using interval-based techniques 
The pitch situation was particularly complex because it varied significantly from city to city and even between churches in the same town. In Leipzig, where Bach worked, there were two main pitch standards: the Chorton ("choir pitch") used in churches, which we now estimate was around A=465Hz, and the Kammerton ("chamber pitch") for secular music, approximately A=415Hz. This difference caused considerable practical problems - Bach often had to transpose parts when performing, and instruments had to be built for specific pitch standards. Historical documents show Bach's frustration with these differences.
When we talk about specific frequencies like A=415Hz or A=465Hz today, we should understand that these are modern interpretations based on historical evidence. However, without precise measuring tools from that era, we cannot be absolutely certain about the exact frequencies used.
This complex situation affected both composers and performers. Musicians needed to be extremely flexible, often requiring different sets of instruments for different pitch standards. The main reference pitch in churches was usually the organ, as it was the most stable instrument and couldn't be easily retuned. But even then, the exact pitch could vary significantly from one church to another.
This historical context helps explain why performing Baroque music today involves careful decisions about pitch. The common modern practice of using A=415Hz for Bach's music, while based on historical evidence, is more of a practical convention than a precise historical recreation.

Chorton and Kammerton in Baroque Germany
In Baroque Germany, there were two main pitch standards because of practical necessities:
Chorton "church pitch"was the fixed pitch of church organs. This pitch couldn't be changed.
Kammerton "chamber pitch"was the standard pitch used by most other instruments. It was about one tone lower than Chorton. Mobile instruments like violins, flutes, and oboes were built to play at this lower pitch because:
They could be used in different places
It was more practical to have one set of instruments instead of two
When playing in church, players could simply transpose their parts up to match the organ's Chorton
We know about these two different pitches from historical documents showing that musicians had to transpose their parts when playing with church organs.
